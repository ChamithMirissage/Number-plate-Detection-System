# Number-plate detection system

A system which can be used to check whether any vehicle is same as a reference vehicle. First a front image of a vehicle(number-plate should be clear) is input to the system. This consists of two models; number-plate detection model and character recognition model. The number-plate detection model was developed using yolov3. The character recognition model was developed by transfer learning the Resnet50 classification model. First the number-plate of the vehicle is detected. Then the characters(English uppercase letters or 0-9 numbers) of the number-plate are separated using openCV contours. They are made in the correct order as number-plate has. Then the images of detected characters are input to the character recognition model which classifies 26 letters and 10 numbers. It outputs the corresponding labels leads to know the number-plate of the vehicle. Then user can check whether that number-plate is same or not to the number-plate of the vehicle he/she wants to find(reference vehicle). This system can be used in highway exits to stop the pre-noticed vehicles. I deployed this system in the localhost.
I created the dataset for character recognition. It includes the images of all the uppercase letters and 0-9 numbers.
